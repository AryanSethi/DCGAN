# Deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGAN)

Implemented a DCGAN inspired by [PyImagesearch blog post](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2020/11/16/gans-with-keras-and-tensorflow/#pyi-pyimagesearch-plus-pricing-modal) 
using Tensorflow & Keras on Fashion MNIST dataset. The model at the end of training was able to create amazing results out of mere random noise. Some output examples are given 
the `output` directory. The `output` directory consists of 40 images out of which, 20 are the ones generated after the training of the 1st epoc and 20 that were outputted at 
the end of training.
