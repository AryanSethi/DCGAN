# Deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGAN)

Implemented a DCGAN inspired by [PyImagesearch blog post](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2020/11/16/gans-with-keras-and-tensorflow/#pyi-pyimagesearch-plus-pricing-modal) 
using Tensorflow & Keras on Fashion MNIST dataset. The model at the end of training was able to create amazing results out of mere random noise. Some output examples are given 
the `example_output` directory. The `example_output` directory consists of 40 images out of which, 20 are the ones generated after the training of the 1st epoc and 20 that were outputted at the end of training. _The real `output` directory containing all the images has not been uploaded._

## Results
<div>
  The following sequence of images show how the network evolved and learned to create proper MNIST images out of total randomness <br>
